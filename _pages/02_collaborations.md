### Multiomics analysis (2021...)
<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
For the investigation of genetic (PsychArray) and epigenetic (EPIC, Illumina Inc.) data produced in a randomized clinical trial in DR Congo, I have been collaborating with the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), namely with Prof. Cynthia Cardoso and Prof. Frederico Henning.

### R community (2021...)
<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
In 2021, I have started supporting the Latin American R community (<a href="https://latin-r.com/en">LatinR</a>). I am a great enthusiast of free software, and the main example for this in my day-to-day experience is the R software. I have helped the organization of LatinR 2021, and gave a tutorial. I plan to further support and participate in the activities of LatinR in the years to come.

Provision of Narrative Exposure Therapy within the public health system. It started as a pilot project in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The plan is to build capacity and scale-up the provision of evidence-based psychotherapy for victims of urban violence who currently visit public clinics in Rio.
